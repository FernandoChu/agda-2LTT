# Coding Style

Here are some rough guidelines with their rationale:

- Try to adapt to Agda-Unimath's coding style as much as possible, this reduces friction between the new definitions and the imported ones.
- Add a `áµ‰`-suffix to files/definitions that could have been defined in Agda-Unimath, again to reduce friction.
So files extending folders must have the suffix (e.g. those in `foundation`), though the definitions may not.
