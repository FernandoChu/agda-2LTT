# Coding Style

Here are some rough guidelines with their rationale:

- Try to adapt to Agda-Unimath's coding style as much as possible, this reduces
  friction between the new definitions and the imported ones.
- Add a `áµ‰`-suffix to definitions that could have been defined in Agda-Unimath,
  again to reduce friction.
